# Austin Housing Data Analsysis

The purpose of this analysis was to look at housing prices in the Austin area spanning the years 2007 - 2016.  The Austin Metropolitan Area is defined differently based on the government agency doing the analysis.  For simplicities sake, only three counties were analyzed: Harris, Williamson, and Travis.  These three counties make up the majority of the Austin area, and it seemed to be a good foundation for analysis

## Data Gathering and Cleaning

All of the data was gathered using the [US Census Website](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217).  The gathered data was all in .csv file and was read into the main Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
